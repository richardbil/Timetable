# Timetable

There is a database now, which can log mitarbeiter, give mitarbeiter a tarifvertrag and log arbeitszeiten by giving every arbeitszeit the corresponding mitarbeiter_id. 

There are example mitarbeiter and example tarifverträge.

The database is in sqlite. On fedora sqlite is normally installed. 'sudo dnf install sqlitebrowser' gives you a gui to look at the database. Or else you can navigate to the folder containing the database and inspect the database with the terminal.
